# Challenge #1

#### Your very talented collaborator has worked for months to optimize a ChIP-seq protocol and was successful! To celebrate, as well as recooperate, your collaborator has decided to take a sabbatical in a remote village in Indonesia to study tree frogs and will be without email or phone contact for the next six months. 

#### Not wanting to waste time you decide to move on with the sequencing and analysis. However, you soon come to realize that labels on the tubes have smeared and are illegible! You decide to submit the samples for sequencing under a generic label and hopefully sort the mess out later.

#### Fortunately, you do know the samples came from mouse and not human. Taking pity on you, a friend at the sequencing facility was kind enough to align the raw sequencing reads to the mouse reference genome, known as mm10, and provide you with the aligned .bam files. 

##### In a ChIP-seq experiment, DNA and protein are crosslinked together and sheared by sonication to generate short fragments of DNA attached to the proteins bound to the DNA. Using an antibody, your collaborator enriched for protein/DNA complexes through immunoprecipitation. As a control, your collaborator also collected DNA prior to the immunoprecipitation step (and is often called the Input control). The crosslinking is then reversed to separate the DNA fragments from the protein. The DNA fragments are then sequenced.

#### Now it's up to you to determine which sample was from the immunoprecipitated transcription factor, and which sample was from the Input control. Because of the anxiety of not knowing which tube was which you have also forgotten the transcription factor as well! (Maybe you need a vacation too). After determining which file is the IP, and which is the Input, you will also need to use your skills to determine the transcription factor for which your collaborator had originally IP'd.

#### As you do your analysis please keep track of your commands. After you have solved the challenge, please present your results to us. Good luck!
